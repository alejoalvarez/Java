# What is a Java Framework?
A framework is a huge body of pre-written code. We need to add this code in our code to solve a problem. We can use a framework by inheritance, calling its methods, or supplying callbacks, listeners, or other implementations of the patterns.

A framework often dictates the structure of an application. Some frameworks provide much code so that we need to write very less in our application. Frameworks can be good or bad, depending on their ease of use. A Java framework is specific to the Java programming language. We can use it as a platform for developing software applications, web applications, and Java programs.

## Java spring framework

Spring Framework is a robust lightweight web application development framework. Its rank is at first place because it has the excellent capability to develop complex web applications that require high performance. The core features of the Spring Framework enables Java developers to easily create enterprise-level applications.

There are many modules present in the Spring framework. Some of them are Spring MVC, Spring Core, Spring Security, Spring Transaction, Spring Boost, Spring ORM. These modules are useful in developing enterprise applications.

Now, let’s see the applications of Java Spring framework:

- Web application development.
- Creating any Java application
- Enterprise Java (JEE)

**Advantages of Spring Framework in java**

- Spring framework has a lightweight container that a user can trigger without using a web server or application server software.
- It supports JDBC that improves the productivity of the applications by reducing the error.
- Spring supports both Annotation-based and XML configuration.
- Spring provides backward compatibility and testability of the code.

## JSF(Java Server Faces)

Oracle developed Java Server Faces (JSF) for developing enterprise applications, native applications, and web applications. It is useful to develop user interfaces for Java-based applications.

JSF is a stable component-based MVC framework. Its architecture distinguishes between application logic and representation.

JSF helps the developers to create user interfaces by dragging and dropping UI components and emphasize more on the presentation layer of their application without knowing client-side technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, in detail.

**Uses of JSF**
- Developing Component-based UI frameworks.
- Building native applications.

**Advantages of JSF**
- JSF is an integral part of Java Enterprise Edition.
- It provides excellent tools and rich libraries for developing applications.
- JSF allows existing backend Java code to extend with a web interface without changing the base application by introducing a new framework.

## Google Web Toolkit

Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is an open-source, free, popular web framework. It helps the developers to develop and debug Ajax applications using Java programming language.

It also helps a developer to create and debug Ajax applications in Java. We can also write complex browser-based applications using GWT, without having expertise in front-end technologies like JavaScript.

GWT provides many awesome features like cross-browser portability, history and management, internationalization, and bookmarking, etc. A lot of Google products such as AdSense, Google Wallet, and Blogger are built using GWT.

**Advantages of GWT**
- It is open-source and completely free.
- GWT is developer-friendly.
- GWT supports reusability for common web development tasks.
- We can also use Google APIs to develop GWT applications.
- GWT offers internationalization, cross-browser portability, UI abstraction, bookmarking, and history management.

## Java Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. This framework acts as a database for developing a stable framework for Java. Object-relational mapping connects data across two incompatible systems. This framework provides better communication between relational database management systems and the Java programming language. It is useful when a user is working in a complex ecosystem and requires a seamless data flow.

Developers face a problem while working with an object-oriented language like Java. This problem is the Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch or Paradigm Mismatch problem. Hibernate provides us with a framework that overcomes these mismatch problems of Java.

The queries in Hibernate are just like HQL (Hive Query Language) SQL(Structured Query Language). This framework directly maps Java classes to corresponding database tables and databases tables to classes.

There is a file in Hibernate called hibernate.cfg.xml file which stores the information about mapping Java classes with database configuration.

**Uses of Java Hibernate**
- It allows you to develop persistent classes using object-oriented concepts.
- Hibernate enables users to communicate with any database using very small changes in the code. This bridges the gap between objects and relational databases.
- Hibernate is an advanced ORM framework that lets us perform the database operation on Java entities.

**Advantages of Java Hibernate framework**
- Hibernate is a powerful cross-database solution.
- Hibernate is a scalable framework.
- We can convert data easily using Hibernate.
- Hibernate is configurable.
