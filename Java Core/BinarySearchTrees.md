# Binary Search Tree (BST) 

Binary Search Tree is the other most important hierarchical data structure in Java. It is similar to the binary trees but has some additional properties like:

- The value of each node N of the right subtree is greater than every value in the left subtree.
- The value of each node N of the left subtree is smaller than every value in the right subtree.
- The left and right subtrees must be a Binary Search Tree.

The primary use of a binary search tree is searching applications like maps where the data enters frequently. Binary search trees provide quick searching and accessing options which are fast as compared to the linked lists.

**Properties of Binary Search Trees:**

- Search: O(h)
- Insertion: O(h)
- Deletion: O(h)

where ‘h’ is the height of the tree.
