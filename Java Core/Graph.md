# Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure in Java and the following two components define it:

- A set of a finite number of vertices which we call as nodes.
- An edge with a finite set of ordered pairs which is in the form (u, v).
- V represents the Number of Vertices.
- N represents the Number of Edges.

## Classification of a Graph

Graph Data Structures in Java can be classified on the basis of two parameters: direction and weight.

### Direction

On the basis of direction, the graph can be classified as a directed graph and an undirected graph.

**Directed graph**

A directed graph is a set of nodes or vertices connect together with each other and all the edges have a direction from one vertex to another. There is a directed edge for each connection of vertices.

**Undirected graph**
An undirected graph is a set of nodes or vertices which are connected together, with no direction

## Weight

On the basis of weight, the graph can be classified as a weighted graph and an unweighted graph.


**Weighted graph**

A weighted graph is a graph in which the weight is present at every edge of the graph. A weighted graph is also a special type of labeled graph.

**Unweighted graph**

An unweighted graph is the one in which there is no weight present on any edge.
