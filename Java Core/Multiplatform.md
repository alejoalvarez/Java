## Multiplatform Java

- The characteristic of being cross-platform is that a program written in java must be compiled and then interpreted by the JRE or JVM
- Compile (Go to source code to machine code)
- Source code is .java
- Java generates an intermediate called bytescode.class which is neither machine code nor .java language. The JRE is applied to this intermediate file to later generate a file interpreted in real time which, if it is machine code
