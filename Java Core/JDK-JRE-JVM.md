## JDK - JRE - JVM

**JDK** is Composed of 3 things:
- **JRE** - Java Runtime Environment, contain the (JVM, libraries, javaw, etc)
    - **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) => Just in Time compiler (JIT)
- Development API 
- Java compiler

```JDK``` is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:

- Standard Edition Java Platform
- Enterprise Edition Java Platform
- Micro Edition Java Platform

The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.

**Components JDK**

|appletviewer: |	This tool is used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser.|
|apt: |	It is an annotation-processing tool.|
|extcheck: |	it is a utility that detects JAR file conflicts.|
|idlj: |	An IDL-to-Java compiler. This utility generates Java bindings from a given Java IDL file.|
|jabswitch:	| It is a Java Access Bridge. Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems.|
|java: |	The loader for Java applications. This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler. Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment. The old deployment launcher, jre, no longer comes with Sun JDK, and instead it has been replaced by this new java loader.|
|javac: |	It specifies the Java compiler, which converts source code into Java bytecode.|
|javadoc: |	The documentation generator, which automatically generates documentation from source code comments|
|jar: |	The specifies the archiver, which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file. This tool also helps manage JAR files.|

|javaws: | the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications.|
|JConsole: |	Java Monitoring and Management Console.|
|jdb:	| the debugger.|
|jhat:	| Java Heap Analysis Tool (experimental).|
|jinfo:	| This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process or crash dump.|
|jmap:	| Oracle jmap - Memory Map- This utility outputs the memory map for Java and can print shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given process or core dump.|
|jmc:	| Java Mission Control|
|jps:	| Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool lists the instrumented HotSpot Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) on the target system.|
|jrunscript:	|Java command-line script shell.|
|jstack:	| It is a utility that prints Java stack traces of Java threads (experimental).|
|jstat:	| Java Virtual Machine statistics monitoring tool (experimental).|
|jstatd:	| jstat daemon (experimental).|
|keytool:	| It is a tool for manipulating the keystore.|
|pack200:	| JAR compression tool.|
|Policytool:	| It specifies the policy creation and management tool, which can determine policy for a Java runtime, specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources.|
|VisualVM:	| It is a visual tool integrating several command-line JDK tools and lightweight [clarification needed] performance and memory profiling capabilities|
|wsimport:	| It generates portable JAX-WS artifacts for invoking a web service.|
|1xjc:	|It is the part of the Java API for XML Binding (JAXB) API. It accepts an XML schema and generates Java classes.|


```JRE``` => Named at the beginning as JVM, it is made up of the JVM, some clasess of the core of the platform and libraries of the own language
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

The implementation of JVM is also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems



```JVM``` (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.

The JVM performs the following main tasks:

- Loads code
- Verifies code
- Executes code
- Provides runtime environment

JVM provides definitions for the:

- Memory area
- Class file format
- Register set
- Garbage-collected heap
- Fatal error reporting etc.

### Classloader

Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.

- Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first classloader which is the super class of Extension classloader. It loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes etc.
- Extension ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader. It loades the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.
- System/Application ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Extension classloader. It loads the classfiles from classpath. By default, classpath is set to current directory. You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch. It is also known as Application classloader.

```java
//Let's see an example to print the classloader name  
public class ClassLoaderExample  
{  
    public static void main(String[] args)  
    {  
        // Let's print the classloader name of current class.   
        //Application/System classloader will load this class  
        Class c=ClassLoaderExample.class;  
        System.out.println(c.getClassLoader());  
        //If we print the classloader name of String, it will print null because it is an  
        //in-built class which is found in rt.jar, so it is loaded by Bootstrap classloader  
        System.out.println(String.class.getClassLoader());  
    }  
} 
```
These are the internal classloaders provided by Java. If you want to create your own classloader, you need to extend the ClassLoader class.


## Class(Method) Area
Class(Method) Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data, the code for methods.

## Heap
It is the runtime data area in which objects are allocated.

## Stack

Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return.

Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as thread.

A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.

##Â Program Counter Register
PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.

## Native Method Stack
It contains all the native methods used in the application.

## Execution Engine
It contains:

- A virtual processor
- Interpreter: Read bytecode stream then execute the instructions.
- Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here, the term "compiler" refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.

## Java Native Interface
Java Native Interface (JNI) is a framework which provides an interface to communicate with another application written in another language like C, C++, Assembly etc. Java uses JNI framework to send output to the Console or interact with OS libraries.
